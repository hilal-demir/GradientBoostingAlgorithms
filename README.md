# Machine Learning Classification - Gradient Boosting Algorithms

This project involves the implementation and comparison of various machine learning classification models. The project is structured in Python and utilizes popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

## Overview

The project covers the following aspects:

1. Data Loading: The data is loaded from an Excel file using Pandas.

2. Data Preprocessing: The target column is defined, and data is prepared for training.

3. Model Implementation: Several machine learning classification models are implemented, including XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, SVM, Random Forest, and Ensemble models.

4. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is performed for some models to evaluate their performance.

5. Confusion Matrix: A function to generate a confusion matrix for multiclass classification is included.

## How to Use

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn xgboost catboost lightgbm matplotlib scikit-learn
